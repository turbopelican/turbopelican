[![turbopelican](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clockback/turbopelican/refs/heads/main/assets/badge/v1.json)](https://github.com/clockback/turbopelican)

An uber-quick tool to create a Pelican static-site and deploy it to GitHub
Pages.

## Usage

Before you run `turbopelican`, create a new repository where you will keep the
source for your website

> ℹ️  **_NOTE:_**  Make sure that the site-url uses the GitHub repository's name.
For example, if you want the website to be `https://johndoe.github.io`, your
GitHub repository will need to be called `johndoe.github.io`.

After your repository is created, copy the git repository URL. You'll need it
later.

Then enter your settings for your repository, and under "**Code and
automation**" click "**Pages**". The section "**Build and deployment**" allows
you to choose a source. Chose "**GitHub actions**".

Next, you need to run `turbopelican`. Users are recommended to run
`turbopelican` using `uvx`:

```sh
$ uvx turbopelican clockback.github.io
Who is the website author? [Ilya Simpson]
What is the name of the website? [clockback.github.io] Time to Clock Back
What timezone will your website use? [Pacific/Auckland]
What language will your website use? [en]
What is your website URL? [https://clockback.github.io]

```

You can use the defaults, or choose your own values. In the example above, I
have decided to give the website a non-default name, but I have left the other
settings. `turbopelican` then creates a new repository `mypersonalsite`, with
everything ready to push to GitHub.

> ℹ️  **_NOTE:_**  Make sure that the site-url uses the GitHub repository's name.
For example, if you want the website to be `https://johndoe.github.io`, your
GitHub repository will need to be called `johndoe.github.io`.

You will then need to push your code to GitHub:

```sh
cd clockback.github.io
git add .
git commit -q -m "Initial commit."
git remote add origin git@github.com:clockback/clockback.github.io.git # Use your own git repo reference
git push -q --set-upstream origin main
```

Now look at your repository on GitHub. You should be able to see the
repository:

![View new repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clockback/turbopelican/refs/heads/main/assets/docs/view-new-repo.png)

If you navigate back to the settings for GitHub Pages, you should see a
message informing you that your website is already live.

> ℹ️  **_NOTE:_** It may take a minute for this prompt to appear, because
GitHub Actions must first deploy your website.

![Site is live](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clockback/turbopelican/refs/heads/main/assets/docs/site-is-live.png)

If you follow the link, you should be able to see your newly deployed website.

### Configuration

Pelican still targets Python 3.9, which does not bundle built-in support for
reading TOML configuration. Projects using `turbopelican` require Python 3.11
or higher, and therefore adopt the newer convention of placing configuration
in a TOML file rather than Python scripts. Generally, you should only need to
modify `turbopelican.toml`, rather than `pelicanconf.py` or `publishconf.py`.
