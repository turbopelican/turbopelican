An uber-quick tool to create a Pelican static-site and deploy it to GitHub
Pages.

## Explanation

GitHub lets you host static websites at your own subdomain. If your GitHub
username is **mrjohndoe**, you can host a website at
`https://mrjohndoe.github.io`. The same applies for organizations. If your
GitHub organization is called **MySpecialOrg**, you can host a website at
`https://myspecialorg.github.io`.

`turbopelican` is a tool which swiftly creates a static website to deploy at
your subdomain. Any developer with a GitHub account and `uv` installed
(**[see here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)**) can
deploy a website in minutes.

## Usage

Before you run `turbopelican`, create a new repository where you will keep the
source for your website.

> ℹ️  **_NOTE:_**  Make sure that the site-url uses the GitHub repository's name.
For example, if you want the website to be `https://johndoe.github.io`, your
GitHub repository will need to be called `johndoe.github.io`.

After your repository is created, copy the git repository URL. You'll need it
later.

![Obtain your repository URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turbopelican/turbopelican/refs/heads/main/assets/docs/get-repo-reference.png)

Then enter your settings for your repository, and under "**Code and
automation**" click "**Pages**". The section "**Build and deployment**" allows
you to choose a source. Chose "**GitHub actions**".

Next, you need to run `turbopelican`. Users are recommended to run
`turbopelican` using `uvx`:

You can use the defaults, or choose your own values. In the example above, I
have decided to give the website a non-default name, but I have left the other
settings. `turbopelican` then creates a new repository
`my-turbopelican-website`, with everything ready to push to GitHub.

> ℹ️  **_NOTE:_**  Make sure that the site-url uses the GitHub repository's name.
For example, if you want the website to be `https://johndoe.github.io`, your
GitHub repository will need to be called `johndoe.github.io`.

You will then need to push your code to GitHub:

```sh
cd my-turbopelican-website
git add .
git commit -q -m "Initial commit."
git remote add origin git@github.com:my-turbopelican-website/my-turbopelican-website.github.io.git # Use your own git repo reference
git push -q --set-upstream origin main
```

Now look at your repository on GitHub. You should be able to see the
repository:

If you navigate back to the settings for GitHub Pages, you should see a
message informing you that your website is already live.

> ℹ️  **_NOTE:_** It may take a minute for this prompt to appear, because
GitHub Actions must first deploy your website.

If you follow the link, you should be able to see your newly deployed website.

### Configuration

Pelican still targets Python 3.9, which does not bundle built-in support for
reading TOML configuration. Projects using `turbopelican` require Python 3.11
or higher, and therefore adopt the newer convention of placing configuration
in a TOML file rather than Python scripts. Generally, you should only need to
modify `turbopelican.toml`, rather than `pelicanconf.py` or `publishconf.py`.

## Development

Ensure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. You will need to create a
[fork](https://github.com/turbopelican/turbopelican/fork) of the repository.
Then you should navigate to GitHub Actions
(*https://github.com/yourusername/turbopelican/actions*) and enable workflows
on your repository. After that, you can clone your fork onto your computer.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/turbopelican.git
cd turbopelican
uv sync
```

When you need to check that the branch can pass CI, you can run the Makefile
like so:

```sh
make ci
```

Once you push your branch to GitHub, the workflow "**Run CI**" should run. If
you have not enabled workflows yet, do so, and then run the workflow manually.
Pull requests should be made only for branches which pass CI. Once it has
passed, you should then open a pull request. If you are contributing a new
feature or breaking changes, you should set the base reference to the current
feature branch. Otherwise, you should set the base reference to **main**.

### NeoVim

Contributors to turbopelican are encouraged to use
[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) as their IDE during development, in conjunction
with [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig). When you
launch NeoVim, you should pass the project's IDE settings like so:

```sh
. .venv/bin/activate
nvim -u init.lua
```

This will ensure that you receive Ruff and Pyright warnings in your editor. It
will also automatically format any Python code on write.
